# Cloud Accounts

Panther's Cloud Security works by scanning AWS accounts, modeling the **Resources** within them, using **Policies** to detect misconfigurations, and (optionally) remediating vulnerable resources.

This feature can be used to power your compliance and improve your cloud security posture. Common security misconfigurations detectable by Panther include:

* S3 Buckets without encryption
* Security Groups allowing inbound SSH traffic from `0.0.0.0/0`
* Access Keys being older than 90 days
* IAM policies that are too permissive

When adding a new AWS account, Panther runs a baseline scan and models all of the resources in your account.

Account scans are performed daily to ensure the most consistent state possible. This works by using an assumable IAM Role with ReadOnly permissions.

Resource updates can be configured to track changes in real-time using CloudTrail or CloudWatch Events.

## Add Your Accounts

The first step is to add a new AWS account source by navigating to `Cloud Security` > `Sources` > `Add Account`:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

Enter your account `Name` and `AWS Account ID`. You can also indicate which resources and regions you would like to exclude from cloud scanning. This can help prevent too many alerts from being generated by regions and resources known to be misconfigured.

If you want to enable real-time scans or automatic remediation, make sure to tick the boxes here!
{% endhint %}

Click `Continue Setup`, then download the generated template or click directly into the CloudFormation Console or use an autogenerated Cloudformation template:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

Clicking the `Launch Console` button will open [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) in the AWS account you are currently logged into with pre-populated stack variables:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-cfn (5).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to check the acknowledgement in the `Capabilities`box
{% endhint %}

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-cfn-2 (9) (2) (1) (14).png>)

Click the `Create stack` button. After about 15 seconds, the stack's `Status` should change to `CREATE_COMPLETE`. If there is an error creating the stack, then an IAM role with the same name may already exist in your account.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-cfn-3 (9) (3) (8).png>)

Back in the UI, click `Next`, then `Save Source` to complete this setup:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup4 (5) (1) (3).png>)

## Configure Real-Time Monitoring

The next section will detail how to monitor changes to AWS resources in real-time.

### Prerequisites

To configure real-time events to Panther from multiple regions and accounts, we can use [AWS CloudFormation StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html).

The following diagram illustrates this with an example model:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-stackset-overview (6).png>)

### Plan Your Account Layout

In this case, the account running Panther will act as the `Administrator` account to manage stack creation and updates.

All other accounts to onboard will act as `Target` accounts to send CloudWatch logs to Panther.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Administrator` account may also be the `Target` account. To run and scan a single AWS account, this will always be the case, and both IAM roles are required.
{% endhint %}

### Setup Administrator Account

First, create the CloudFormation StackSet Admin role in the main Panther account to manage the deployment of real-time events in your target accounts.

From the CloudFormation Console, create a new stack, select `Template is ready`, and enter the following `Amazon S3 URL`:

```
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/panther-public-cloudformation-templates/panther-stackset-iam-admin-role/latest/template.yml
```

Click the acknowledgements and create the stack.

This IAM role allows the CloudFormation StackSet to assume roles in target accounts and orchestrate the configuration of real-time events:

```javascript
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/PantherCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole-<PantherRegion>",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This IAM Role is only assumable by the Panther Deployment account.
{% endhint %}

### Onboard Accounts

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for target accounts to be onboarded, you must have checked the "Real-Time AWS Resource Scan" box during the account setup.
{% endhint %}

Login to the `Administrator` account's AWS Console, and open the [CloudFormation StackSets](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacksets) page:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-stacksets-1 (12) (1) (14).png>)

Click the `Create StackSet` button on the top right, select `Template is ready`, and enter the following `Amazon S3 URL`:

```
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/panther-public-cloudformation-templates/panther-cloudwatch-events/latest/template.yml
```

Click `Next`.

Name the StackSet `panther-real-time-events`.

Enter the 12-digit AWS Account ID where Panther is deployed in the `MasterAccountId` field.

In the `QueueArn` field, paste the following (substituting the AWS account ID of the account running Panther):

```
arn:aws:sqs:<PantherRegion>:<PantherAccountID>:panther-aws-events-queue
```

Click `Next`.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-stacksets-2 (11).png>)

Under the Permissions tab, add the IAM admin role name:

```
PantherCloudFormationStackSetAdminRole-<MASTER_ACCOUNT_REGION>
```

And the IAM execution role name:

```
PantherCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole-<MASTER_ACCOUNT_REGION>
```

Click `Next`.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-stacksets-3 (10).png>)

Add the AWS Account IDs of the Target Accounts in the Account numbers field, separated by commas.

Select `Add all regions` or a list of desired regions, set `Maximum concurrent accounts` to 5, and click `Next`.

Click `Submit` at the bottom of the page to create the StackSet.

To check on the status of the StackSet, check the `Operations` tab:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/setup-stacksets-4 (9) (13) (5) (1) (4).png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
Awesome! You should now have real-time CloudWatch events sending to Panther.
{% endhint %}

### Adding Additional Accounts

To add more accounts to the StackSet above, use the following steps:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you have at least one AWS Account Source configured with the `DeployCloudWatchEventSetup`set to`true`
{% endhint %}

1. Sign in to the `Administrator` account's AWS Console
2. On the [CloudFormation StackSets](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacksets) page, select the `panther-real-time-events` StackSet
3. Select the `Actions` button on the top right and select `Add new stacks to StackSet`
4. Add the new AWS account ID's into the Account numbers field, specify regions, and click through to the `Submit` button
