# Panther Enterprise

Panther offers an enterprise-ready product with all of the community features, plus:

* [Data Explorer](../data-analytics/data-explorer.md) to search collected data
* [SaaS Logs](../data-onboarding/saas-logs/)
* [Data Compaction](../data-analytics/backend/log-compaction.md) for faster queries
* [Role-Based Access Control](../system-configuration/rbac.md)
* [SAML/SSO](../system-configuration/saml/)
* [Snowflake](../data-analytics/backend/snowflake.md)
* Customer Support

Panther Enterprise can be deployed in your own AWS account \(Cloud-Prem\) or managed by Panther \(Cloud\) in our single-tenant hosted environment.

## Upgrading from Community

An existing Panther deployment can be upgraded in-place to Enterprise with no data loss or extra configuration required. The [deploy process](../quick-start.md) is the same.
