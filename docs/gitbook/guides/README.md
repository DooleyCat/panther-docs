# Guides

Panther Guides are designed to help you work through common end-to-end workflows on the Panther platform. 

These workflows can include onboarding specific types of logs that aren't yet supported by Panther, creating custom detections to build alerting for specific events, or performing investigations on indicators of interest. 

If you find these guides useful and have a specific request, be sure to reach out to your Panther account representative!
