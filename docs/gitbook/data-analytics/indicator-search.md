# Indicator Search

The Indicator Search is designed to be simple and easy to use:

* Start your investigation with one or more known indicators.
* Copy & paste the indicator\(s\) into the search field. The search will find ALL connected events associated with the indicators

  in the specified time range.

  * You can mix types of indicators \(e.g., IP addresses, domain names, ARNs, file hashes\).

* A timeline histogram shows the concentration of events over the specified time interval.
* Drill down into specific events by pivoting into the Data Explorer with prebuilt SQL queries.
* Find additional indicators in the Data Explorer and perform another search to gain additional context about the attack.
* Continue to pivot through your data to map the entire attacker footprint.

As with all of our enterprise features, access to the Indicator Search can be limited through our [Role-Based Access Control](../system-configuration/rbac.md) system.
